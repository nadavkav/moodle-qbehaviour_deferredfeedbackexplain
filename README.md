### Overview
A simple hack to get students answer X out of Y questions in a quiz, given they marked the relevant questions they choose 
to get a grade for with a flag.
### Setup
* Quiz settings: choose this question behaviour ('Deferred feedback, grade only flagged')
* Quiz settings: better hide all "Marks" under "Review options" from students as they do not show the proper filnal grades, but a confusing calculate which is good for a regular quiz without these hacking ;-)
* Quiz edit: make sure that "Maximum grade" and "Total of marks" as the same, and probably exceed 100 points 
  * Example1: For 2 out of 3 questions, where visual to the students max grade is 100, set each question to 50 (points/weight)
  * Example2: For 10 out of 12 questions, where visual to the students max grade is 100, set each question to 10 (points/weight)

Most welcome :-)
